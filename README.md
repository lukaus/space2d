# Space2d 
2d space simulator

i want a 2d gravity sim

uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

to add:
    - fix jittery camera when panning (might be related to separation of ticks and camera)
    - figure out how to scale tick/time relation
    - save and exit simulation, ability to resume
    - ability to center camera on object
    - ability to display approx. date/time and change tick from 1t=1/60th of a second up to 1t=1yr
    - adjust TPS on the fly
    - separate display from ticks
    - simple collisions (right now, simulation breaks down when objects come close to colliding)
    - complex collisions (objects break into many little objects upon colliding) (this would be hard lol)
    - create objects on the fly, burn fuel produce accelleration etc
